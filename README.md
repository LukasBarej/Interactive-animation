# Interactive-animation

My diploma work at Creative Coding Course at SWPS. Artistic installation, which is conceived around a discussion of reconstruction of Saxon Palace in Warsaw. The main concept is to show the price of loosing parts of our identities for a better life today and how we should remember the sacrifice. 

The idea is to show, through an interactive animation, the process of building the palace, which is triggered by the movement of people passing through the Pi≈Çsudski square from a recorded footage.

To achieve that I am using motion detection and blob detection algorithms to track every person.

Later every person will leave their marks on the surface of the square and the animation will progress with the movement.

At the same time, the animation will be displayed and the movement of the people in the exhibition space will erase parts already built. Using an M5 camera, movement will be tracked and construction of the palace will be rewound, resulting in a never ending discussion whether it should be rebuilt.
